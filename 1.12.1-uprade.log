Success. Now the Istio control plane is running at version 1.12.1.

To upgrade the Istio data plane, you will need to re-inject it.
If you’re using automatic sidecar injection, you can upgrade the sidecar by doing a rolling update for all the pods:
    kubectl rollout restart deployment --namespace <namespace with auto injection>
If you’re using manual injection, you can upgrade the sidecar by executing:
    kubectl apply -f < (istioctl kube-inject -f <original application deployment yaml>)
